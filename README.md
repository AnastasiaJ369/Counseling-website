THERAPY/COUNSELING SERVICE DEMO

Created with HTML, CSS, and REACT, the goal of this project was to create a therapy/counseling website one might see in their search for mental health services. With a functional bookings page, potential
clients will be able to schedule appointments with a responsive calendar. The Bookings page is accessible via clicking the section name in the Navbar or by clicking the 'Schedule An Appointment' button
on the homepage. Also included is an embedded link that presents a google maps of an example location and the ability for potential clients to open the maps in another tab.

All images used in this demo were obtained from google, however, they are easily replaceable should someone want to use this website as their own.

As of now, the intial template of the site is complete with complete pages, animations, and a contact form for potential Bookings. Submitting the contact form presents with a message 'Thank you for reaching out! We'll be in touch soon!' While I can continue my education, further changes will be made to the project in the future!

Once I've learned how to host the websute and provide a demo, it'll go here: ________________________
