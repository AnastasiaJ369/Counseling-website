THERAPY/COUNSELING SERVICE DEMO

Created with HTML, CSS, and REACT, the goal of this project was to create a therapy/counseling website one might see in their search for mental health services. With a functional bookings page, potential
clients will be able to schedule appointments with a responsive calendar. The Bookings page is accessible via clicking the section name in the Navbar or by clicking the 'Schedule An Appointment' button
on the homepage. Also included is an embedded link that presents a google maps of an example location and the ability for potential clients to open the maps in another tab.

All images used in this demo were obtained from google, however, they are easily replaceable should someone want to use this website as their own.

As of now, the homepage, about me page, services and conttact us are just about finished aside from minor changes. The next session will be mainly focused on getting the bookings page set up.

As I can continue my education, further changes will be made tothe project in the future!
